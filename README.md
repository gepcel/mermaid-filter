A fork of [mermaid](https://github.com/raghur/mermaid-filter) with the following changes:

* Change the default `width` to 1000, default `loc` to `image`
* Add an option `hide` default to `false`, which means show the code before the image

I don't think it's helpful for others, so leave it here.
